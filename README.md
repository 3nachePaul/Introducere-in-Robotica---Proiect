# Introduction  

**Project Name:** DIY Safe Box 

**Functionality:**  
An interactive safe that allows the user to guess a numeric combination displayed on a screen. Once the correct value is entered, a servo motor unlocks the safe mechanism. RFID cards can also be used for access.  

**Purpose:**  
To develop a simple security device based on knowledge of electronics, programming, and communication protocols.  

**Inspiration:**  
I wanted to make a safe and then I found a game made by someone and I wanted to do the same thing, but on my own. I will attach the video in the Resources paragraph.  

**Usefulness:**  
- **For me:** Practical understanding of protocols and hardware components.  
- **For others:** Inspiration for similar projects, use as an educational device, or as a game.  


**Block Diagram:**

All components interact through the master microcontroller, which handles the application logic and communication with the slave microcontroller for RFID access validation.

   <summary>Making of the box and soldering</summary>

## Making The Box

Isketched 13cm length squares on a 2mm tichness mdf board that I cut suing 2 types of saw and I made the holes using a hand drill.
The squares were attached to each other using corner guard and screws.



## Soldering

I soldered the resistors to the leds, the pin header connector to the RC522 and the wires: to the leds, between them and to a pin header connector.
I used a [plusivo soldering kit](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/ro/kituri/12919-kit-plusivo-pentru-lipit-eu-v5-cu-multimetru-digital.html?search_query=kit+ipit&results=33).

## Overview
Initializes the components and prepares the system for operation. Sets up communication with the serial monitor and OLED display. Configures the servo motor, LEDs, rotary encoder, and button. Prepares interrupts for encoder handling and seeds the random number generator. Runs initial animations, locks the safe, and generates a new code.

The `setup` function is called once when the microcontroller starts. It initializes various components and sets up the initial state of the system.

### Serial.begin(9600);
- Initializes the serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. This is used for debugging and communication with the serial monitor.

### if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C)) { ... }
- Initializes the OLED display with the I2C address 0x3C. If the display initialization fails, it prints an error message to the serial monitor and enters an infinite loop.

### display.clearDisplay();
- Clears the OLED display.

### lockServo.attach(2);
- Attaches the servo motor to pin 2.

### Wire.begin();
- Initializes the I2C communication.

### // Initialize LEDs
- Initializes the pins for the LEDs and sets them to LOW (off). The LEDs are used to indicate the correct number and placement of digits in the code.

### for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { ... }
- Sets the pin mode for each LED pin to OUTPUT and turns off the LEDs by setting them to LOW.

### // Initialize encoder
- Initializes the pins for the rotary encoder and sets up interrupts to handle changes in the encoder's state.

### pinMode(PIN_A, INPUT_PULLUP);
- Sets the pin mode for the encoder's A pin to INPUT_PULLUP.

### pinMode(PIN_B, INPUT_PULLUP);
- Sets the pin mode for the encoder's B pin to INPUT_PULLUP.

# loop Function

```
void loop() {
    if (correctGuess) {
        unlockSafe();
        return;
    }

    if (checkStopSignal()) {
        displayAccessGrantedMessage();

    }

    handleCodeInput();
    numGuesses++;
    evaluateGuess();

    resetGuess();
    updateDisplayCode();
    }
}
```

The `loop` function runs continuously after the `setup` function has completed. It handles the main logic of the program, including checking for correct guesses, handling code input, and controlling the servo motor.

## Overview
It checks to see if the slave arduino gave the signal that the correct UID was scanned and displays the animation for that and unlocks the safe. It lets the user introduce a code, verifies it and resets the array for the guess if it is wrong. If the code is correct then it will display the animation for thatn and unlock the safe.

### if (correctGuess) { ... }
- Checks if the user has guessed the correct code. If `correctGuess` is true, it calls the `unlockSafe` function to unlock the safe and returns to exit the loop.

### if (checkStopSignal()) { ... }
- Checks if a stop signal has been received (e.g., correct RFID placed). If true, it calls the `displayAccessGrantedMessage` function to display the "Access - - - - Granted" message and the `unlockSafe` function to unlock the safe, then returns to exit the loop.

### handleCodeInput();
- Calls the `handleCodeInput` function to process the user's input for the code.

### numGuesses++;
- Increments the `numGuesses` variable to keep track of the number of guesses made by the user.

### evaluateGuess();
- Calls the `evaluateGuess` function to evaluate the user's guess against the correct code.

### resetGuess();
- Calls the `resetGuess` function to reset the user's guess.

### updateDisplayCode();
- Calls the `updateDisplayCode` function to update the code displayed on the OLED screen.

**Master Microcontroller Responsibilities:**  
1. Displaying status messages and user input on the LCD.  
2. Managing buttons for user input.  
3. Controlling the servo motor using PWM signals.  
4. Communicating with the slave microcontroller via I2C to check RFID access status.  

**Slave Microcontroller Responsibilities:**  
1. Handling RFID card reading using the MFRC522 module.  
2. Validating RFID cards against a predefined list of valid UIDs.  
3. Sending a stop signal to the master microcontroller via I2C when access is granted.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Interrupt Handling:** To detect button presses and manage input actions on the master.  
- **Communication Protocols:**  
  - I2C for master-slave communication.  
  - SPI for RFID reader communication with the slave.  
- **RFID Validation Logic:** To authenticate users with predefined card UIDs.  
- **Servo Control:** Unlocks the safe when the correct combination is entered or RFID access is granted.  
</details>

   <summary>Flow and Demo</summary>


## Flow  

1. **Turning the Safe On:**  
   - The switch is turned on, and a message is displayed on the OLED ("CRACK THE CODE!").  
   - The game begins, and the player can start guessing the combination.  

2. **Guessing the Combination:**  
   - The player enters a combination using the encoder.  
   - LEDs indicate the number of correct digits and their positions.  
   - The process continues until the correct combination is entered.  

3. **RFID Access:**  
   - The slave microcontroller reads RFID cards using the MFRC522 module.  
   - Valid cards unlock the safe by sending a stop signal to the master via I2C.  
   - The OLED displays "Access Granted!" when a valid card is scanned.  

4. **Unlocking the Safe:**  
   - If the correct combination is entered or a valid RFID card is scanned, the servo motor unlocks the safe.  
   - The OLED displays "Unlocked!"  

5 **Restarting the Game**
   - Afther the "Unlocked!" message the OLED displays "Press the button" and an animation.
   - When the button is pressed the motor will lock the safe again and the game logic will restart.

6. **Safe Turned Off:**  
   - If the switch is turned off, the safe is powered down and the game is reset.

## Other

-Because the microcontrollers, the breadboards and the battery support are not fiex in place once the safe is lifted the connection
of the components is most likely to be distrubed, it is recommended to put the safe on a stable surface to use it for now.
- If I were to redo the project I would get larger walls for the safe as well as better wire management from the very begining.
